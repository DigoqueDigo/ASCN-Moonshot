# ShotKube 

A cloud-native deployment and provisioning project for the [Moonshot](https://github.com/ASCN-UM/moonshot) application. Designed with scalability, automation, and observability in mind, this project uses Kubernetes, Ansible, Docker, and Google Cloud to manage deployment pipelines, handle infrastructure provisioning, and execute performance tests in real-world scenarios.

## üìå Overview

- Automate the provisioning and deployment of a multilayer application
- Ensure service availability, scalability, and fault tolerance
- Monitor system performance using real workloads and metrics
- Use modern tools such as Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana, Docker, and GCP

---

## üöÄ Deployment

To automate the deployment and testing process on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), use the following Ansible playbooks:

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Create and Destroy GKE Cluster

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory/gcp.yml gke-cluster-create.yml
# To destroy the cluster
ansible-playbook -i inventory/gcp.yml gke-cluster-destroy.yml
```
----

### üì¶ Deploy and Undeploy Moonshot

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory/gcp.yml moonshot-deploy.yml
# To undeploy the application
ansible-playbook -i inventory/gcp.yml moonshot-undeploy.yml
```

---

### üî¨ Run Load Tests

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory/gcp.yml load-test.yml
```

---

### ‚úÖ Execute All Tests (Deployment + Load Testing + Monitoring)

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory/gcp.yml test-all.yml
```

---

## üìä Metrics

Monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing the health, performance, and resilience of the Moonshot system. This project uses Prometheus to collect metrics and Grafana to visualize them via dashboards.

### Pod-Level Metrics

- **CPU & Memory Usage:** Tracks resource consumption to detect saturation and trigger HPA scaling
- **Network Throughput:** Monitors incoming/outgoing data for bottlenecks and bandwidth usage
- **Storage Usage:** Observes ephemeral and persistent volume usage, ensuring there's no disk exhaustion

| **Metric**     | **Graphic**                      | 
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| **CPU usage**                    | ![pod_cpu](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e16f253-4293-4978-8e78-1beb8a8b131a)                |

### Node-Level Metrics

- **Resource Distribution:** Ensures that load is balanced across the Kubernetes nodes
- **CPU & RAM:** Helps determine whether the nodes are over or under-utilized, which informs autoscaling needs

### Client-Side Metrics (via k6 / JMeter)

- **Request Duration:** Measures latency and responsiveness of the application under different loads
- **Request Rate:** Indicates throughput capacity of the system
- **Failed Requests:** Alerts on system failures and backend unavailability during stress tests

### Workload Testing

- **Simple Workload:** Simulates 300 virtual users hitting /api/health to test autoscaling of the application server
- **Complex Workload:** Simulates 20 users performing login and certificate creation, stressing the database and I/O
